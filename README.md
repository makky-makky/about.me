<h2>This "read.me" is my introduction. </h2>
I am Japanese, but I want to live abroad in the future, so I am writing this in English as part of my studies.
<br>I was working as an osteopath, but I questioned my working style and the old hierarchical relationship, so I moved to the IT industry where my abilities are relatively easily reflected in my evaluations. ï¼ˆI have no experience in the IT industry, so I will continue to develop my skills.)
<br>Here I will post the knowledge and portfolio I have gained in the course of my work as a systems engineer.
